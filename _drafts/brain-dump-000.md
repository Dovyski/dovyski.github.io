I have some strictly defined goals and projects to which I have to devote undivided attention, i.e. ***work***. However I keep on having ideas for new projects. They are piling up in my brain, taking up some valuable space and mental energy.

As a solution for that, I thought it would be a good idea to create a "brain dump". It is a snapshot of all the ideas currently surfacing my head. This dump will help me keep track of things in the future. It is also a good list to go back to when I have some free time and want to invest on a (new) side project.

Without further ado, below are all project ideas I had in the last few months. Projects are listed without any particular order.

## Operator

Operator is a software able to learn (and repeat) software tasks, e.g. open a web browser, access a page then click a particular link. Both the learning and the repetition process are **visually based**, which means operator is actually analyzing the screen during the process. Operator will solve some particular needs of mine, such as installing software, taking screenshots for documentation, among others.

The greatest challenge is to make the tool "understand" what is happening on the screen, such as identifying that a click on a button just occurred. Operator is also a corner stone in my plan to create something close to Jarvis (yeah yeah, I know, but I have to start somewhere, don't I?).

## Aura brain

Aura brain is the evolution of [Aura](https://github.com/Dovyski/Aura), my currently limited AI-based manager for academic labs. The idea is to improve Aura with a knowledge graph, which will allow more complex tasks to be performed. In order for this project to be somehow useful, it needs to be generic enough to work on contexts other than my own university. I think the effort is worth a try, because Aura can become an excellent helper.

## Aura console

Aura console is lite, enhanced and mobile version of [Aura client](https://github.com/Dovyski/Aura/tree/master/api/client). It will provide a minimalist interface to interact with Aura. One of my goals with this project is to drastically facilitate the exchange of information among clients (mobile or desktop) using unconventional methods, e.g. sound waves.

## HaxeFlixel Studio

I love the [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com) game engine. It is simple, yet very powerful. I have made some contributions to it in the past, but my ideas to improve the engine do not quite fit into its core. They are more like a collection of plugins. I plan to create a HaxeFlixel lib called Studio that will work as the Unity editor for HaxeFlixel. It will allow developers to quickly create game levels, organize things on the screen, etc.

My main focus is on game creation, so Studio should help developers create great games. I indent to focus on map/level creation, particles and animations. Imagine a tool like Adobe Animator (formely Adobe Flash) built-in in HaxeFlixel, so you can easily create cut-scenes for your game.

## Codetex

TBD.

## Uni

This is a project to gamify university activity. Each student will have a profile and a set of achievements, which will be connected to real activities, e.g. results of an assignment. I had already worked on [Progbot](https://github.com/Dovyski/Progbot) in the past, which is a web tool to organize and grade programming assignments. Uni will be like a hub for modules like Progbot.  

## Better education

I am frustrated with the way we educate. Education methods have not substantially changed in the past 200 years. I think we can do better. I indent to re-formulate my classes around the concept of running a company. I am fed up with trying to imitate real life in a classroom using exams, exercises and contained assignments. Those are silly jokes compared to the real-world jungle that exists out there.

My goal for this project is to design and implement the software that will help me apply this (crazy) ideas into my classes.   

## Games

I could have an entry for each new game idea I have, but I think it is better to organize them all under the same item. I have *lots* of game ideas: a mobile game about imploding buildings; a platformer involving a cat fighting in the best Mega Man/Contra III/Kung Fu Panda style; a 3D, semi-isometric strategy game about moving survivors from one place to another by tracing their path; finally improve my existing mobile game [Blacksmith Dash](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.loopyape.blacksmithdash.BlacksmithDash), which I think is good enough to receive more attention.

And that's all! I can't wait to see how I will miserably fail to implement all (or some) of this projects in the future (more likely the next decade). If nothing else, this brain dump will serve as a permanent reminder to keep things simple and achievable.

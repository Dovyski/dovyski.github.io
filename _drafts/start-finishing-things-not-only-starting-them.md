I am pleased to inform that version [2.0.0](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui/releases/tag/v2.0.0) of [cvui](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui) is out! cvui is a simple UI lib built on top of OpenCV drawing primitives. This post is a bit overdue since the release happened in May, but better late than never.

Version 2.0.0 is packed with new features, however the API remains the same, so it is quite easy to upgrade. The inner parts of cvui have been completely overhauled, allowing better support for old versions of OpenCV, e.g. `2.x`.

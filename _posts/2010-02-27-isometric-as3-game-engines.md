After <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=57132175859" target="_blank">Happy Farm</a> and <a href="http://www.farmville.com/" target="_blank">FarmVille</a> attracted millions of user there is a lot of talking about isometric games. I&#8217;ve played several games featuring an isometric view then I&#8217;ve spent some thoughts around the idea of creating my own isometric game (or one for my company, developed during my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">inexistent</span> free time).

Looking for isometric game engines, I found three great projects: [FFilmation](http://www.ffilmation.org), [As3isolib](http://code.google.com/p/as3isolib/) and <a href="http://www.openspace-engine.com/" target="_blank">OpenSpace</a>.

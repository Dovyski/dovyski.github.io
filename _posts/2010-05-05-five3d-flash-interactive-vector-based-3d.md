If you are looking for something different to make you game or Flash app looks better than the rest then you must take a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/five3d/" target="_blank">FIVe3D.</a> It is an open source code for the conception of interactive vector-based 3D animations.

It is licensed under the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License.</a> One of my favorites demos is the <a href="http://five3d.mathieu-badimon.com/gallery/fluo/" target="_blank">Fluo Board</a>.

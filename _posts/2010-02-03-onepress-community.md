I see lots of open source projetcs using <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Worpress</a> as a blog platform, <a href="http://phpbb.com" target="_blank">phpBB</a> as a forum solution and <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org" target="_blank">Mediawiki</a> as a wiki. I like them all, but maintaining them separately with no integrations is a pain. It&#8217;s great when you register to a website and you can use the same fresh new account to comment on the blog, reply to a forum thread and/or contribute to a wiki page.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Excluding the wiki part, there is a tool that makes it all possible. <a title="OnePress" href="http://onepresscommunity.com/" target="_blank">OnePress</a> <em></em>is an integrated website and forum solution. It is, simply, a <strong>WordPress theme</strong> to serve as the foundation and framework for your web site and online  community.

Some of it´s cool features:

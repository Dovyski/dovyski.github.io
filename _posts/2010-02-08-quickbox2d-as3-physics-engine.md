The first time I saw a really convincing physics engine working on a PC game was during a <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/hl2.html" target="_blank">Half Life 2</a> session. All that [Havok physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havok_%28software%29 "Havok (software)") created an unique game experience. Luckily the use of physics inside games has grown and now we have a wide range of tool to use, even in Flash games.[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2353" src="http://www.dovyski.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/poly_editor-300x224.gif" alt="" width="300" height="224" />](http://www.dovyski.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/poly_editor.gif)

<a href="http://actionsnippet.com/?page_id=1391" target="_blank">QuickBox2D</a> is one of them. It is a mini-library created to work with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/box2dflash/" target="_blank">Box2DFlashAS3</a>, which is an AS3 port of the famous <a href="http://box2d.org" target="_blank">Box2D</a> C++ physics engine. The main purpose of this library is to significantly simplify instantiation of rigid bodies and provide a simple way to bind them with custom graphics.

You can start with <a href="http://actionsnippet.com/?page_id=1391" target="_blank">QuickBox2D</a> by reading this <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/effects/introduction-to-quickbox2d-part-1/" target="_blank">great kick off tutorial</a>. It explains the engine itself and demonstrate how to use some of it&#8217;s features.

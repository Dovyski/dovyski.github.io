It&#8217;s been three weeks since I started working on this book. During Friday the 15th I finished the summary. I came up with 19 chapters! That&#8217;s more than I previously thought, but since it&#8217;s a draft, I can cut some chapters along the way.

Today I finally started writing something. Damn, it was **hard**! It&#8217;s been almost 3 years since I wrote something big (my master thesis) , so I had to brush all that dust. The key secret for every endeavor is persistence, so it took me some time to get things working again. At the end of the day I was really proud of my result. It was a small piece of text, but it served the purpose of warming things up.

Analyzing the current scene I will merge some chapters and change the main subject of others. However that&#8217;s a task for the future and for my next Friday.

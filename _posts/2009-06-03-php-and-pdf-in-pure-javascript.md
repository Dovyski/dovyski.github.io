Javacript is the very first base stone concerning web 2.0. In the past, I always heard bad things about Javascript, but I guess all of them were said because Javascript was being used by the wrong people, in the wrong place and at the wrong time.

**<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="PHP.JS" src="http://phpjs.org/img/phpjs.png" alt="" width="114" height="60" />**A lot of sites use huge Javacript libs, each one performing nice things, such as HTTP requests, animation effects, generation of RIA content, etc. Javascript is so famous now that several things have been ported to it, such as encryption algorithms.

I have found two of those Javascript ports that can be really useful, specially if you are a PHP developer (just like me): <a title="PHP.JS" href="http://phpjs.org/" target="_blank">PHP.JS</a> and <a title="jsPDF" href="http://code.google.com/p/jspdf/" target="_blank">jsPDF</a>.<img class="alignright" title="jsPDF" src="http://www.iadis.org/ijcsis/images/PDF_icon.jpg" alt="" width="74" height="74" />

**PHP.JS** is an open source project in which you can use PHP functions client-side, in pure JavaScript. **jsPDF** is an open-source library for generating PDF documents using nothing but Javascript.

Sometimes I find myself solving the same problems again and again on several different projects. Definitely there is no need to reinvent the wheel, you just have to use the right tools.

Theses days I found a perfect help on that subject. <a title="As3 Utils" href="http://github.com/as3/as3-utils/" target="_blank">AS3 utils</a> is a set of useful function that solve common problems such as randomizing or summing the values of an a array. All functions were collected from several open souce projects from the Internet, so there is no unified license.

These days I was looking for intranet solutions and I luckily found <a href="http://openatrium.com/" target="_blank">Open Atrium</a>, an intranet in a box that has group spaces to allow different teams to have their own conversations.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

OpenAtrium is built on top of <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, has a nice design and a useful set of features:

  * **Blog**: A classic blog for each group that has commenting, file attachments on both the post and comments, and granular notifications.
  * **Calendar**: A calendar that lets you quickly add events, suck in iCal and other calendar feeds, and support single or multi-day events.
  * **Group Dashboard**: Mini widgets give you a snapshot of all the activity happening across your groups.
  * **Documents**: A simple online handbook that lets you collaborate on documents, store and compare revisions, attach files, and once you&#8217;re done print out the final copy.
  * **Shoutbox**: Kind of like a private twitter, the shoutbox lets you share short messages, links, and information with just the people in your group.
  * **Case Tracker**: A full ticketing system that lets you assign to do&#8217;s and create unlimited projects within each of your groups. The case tracker also lets you classify the to do, give it a priority, and manage its status.

For small companies, it is an efficient tool to create/maintain an intranet.

If you work with Flash like I do you probably have said a bunch of bad words while you were coding AS3 using the native Flash IDE AS editor. I like Adobe, I really do, Flash can do amazing things and the IDE is getting more and more powerfull, however as a AS3 project manager, the Flash IDE sucks.

I could have saved tons of working hours if Flash IDE had some sort of smart code completion, or if it had a better project manager panel (a simple one that hides the SVN directories, for instance). The logical choise for me would be change to another IDE or methodology, such as <a title="Flex Builder" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" target="_blank">Flex Buider</a>, but sometimes I&#8217;m binded to the Flash IDE because I can&#8217;t use a different approach.

Thanks to the open source community, I&#8217;ve found FlashDevelop, a  free and open source ActionScript 2/3 and web development environment.  It seemlessly integrates with [Adobe Flash IDE](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/){.postlink}, [Adobe Flex SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk){.postlink}, [Mtasc](http://mtasc.org/){.postlink}, [Haxe](http://haxe.org/){.postlink} and [Swfmill](http://www.swfmill.org/){.postlink}.

Some of the features:

  * [AS2 Project management](http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Features:Interface){.postlink} with seamless Swfmill and Mtasc integration (using a portable standalone command line tool).
  * [Advanced ActionScript 2 and ActionScript 3 completion & code exploration](http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Features:Completion){.postlink} with automatic classpath detection (even without project).
  * [Smart contextual Actionscript code generators.](http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Features:Generation){.postlink}
  * [SWF and SWC classes and symbols exploration.](http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=Features:Exploration){.postlink}
  * Test movie in Adobe Flash IDE and with clickable error results (Flash CS3).
  * MTASC compilation/code checking with clickable error results.
  * Types Explorer.
  * Automatically cleans ASO files of modified AS2 classes.
  * Files explorer (can create Flash 8 Trust Files for you).
  * Automatic JavaDoc creation from methods.
  * Smart Actionscript help websearch on F1.
  * Jump to class/member declaration on F4.
  * XML, HTML/PHP, JS, CSS code highlighting.
  * Multibyte character encoding.
  * Program menu customization with XML files.
  * as2api GUI for documentation generation.
  * Snippets, lines bookmarks, code folding and zoom.

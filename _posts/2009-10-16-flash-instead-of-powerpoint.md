  Probably I&#8217;ve spent several hours editing and arranging pictures to create a nice Powerpoint presentation. Even though the Microsoft product is a great tool, I do not like the final result. It seems unfashionable, too poor and/or simple.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This is one of the reasons why I like image sliders developed using Flash. I look at them and imagine how wonderful life would be if I could easily use it and some lines of text in a .txt file to create a presentation. Nice graphics, beautiful font rendering, smooth effects (including blur and glow) and maybe some <a href="http://box2dflash.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">physics</a>, why not?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Trying to make my dream come true, I found two amazing image/content sliders in Flash: <a title="MagaZine 3" href="http://megazine.mightypirates.de/">MegaZine 3</a> and <a title="cu3er" href="http://www.progressivered.com/cu3er/">CU3ER</a>. The first one is an open source pageflip/flashbook engine, written completely in AS3.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" title="Pageflip" src="http://megazine.mightypirates.de/img/content/demo.png" alt="" width="272" height="189" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The other one is a content slider with 3D transition effects, such as spinning.
</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Certainly those two projects have lots of cool features and they can perfectly fit into a wide range of uses. If I have the change to save some time for my personal projects, such as my <a href="http://www.dovyski.com/projects/" target="_blank">own Flash slide presentation</a>, I will use <a title="MagaZine 3" href="http://megazine.mightypirates.de/">MegaZine 3</a> and <a title="cu3er" href="http://www.progressivered.com/cu3er/">CU3ER</a> for sure.

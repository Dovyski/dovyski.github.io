## Research projects

### READMINDS: REmote Analysis and Detection of Multifactorial INputs for Discovery of Stress
**Date:** 2015 - present

**Sponsorship:** CNPq, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - Brasil; University of Skövde; EU Interreg ÖKS project Game Hub Scandinavia; UFFS, Federal University of Fronteira Sul.

**Abstract:** Improve the research in games by creating a model/software that is able to tell if a player is stressed/bored while playing a game. The process involves the analysis of information from the player (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, facial expressions) which are obtained by processing a video of the player. The procedure is completely remote, so the user does not wear physical sensors nor is interrupted during the game play.

<h2>Remote Analysis and Detection of Multifactorial Inputs for Detection of Stress</h2>
<p class="meta"><em>Date: 2015-present. Sponsorship: CNPq, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - Brasil; University of Skövde; EU Interreg ÖKS project Game Hub Scandinavia; UFFS, Federal University of Fronteira Sul.</em></p>

<p class="description small">
Improve the research in games by creating a model/software that is able to tell if a player is stressed/bored while playing a game. The process involves the analysis of information from the player (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, facial expressions) which are obtained by processing a video of the player. The procedure is completely remote, so the user does not wear physical sensors nor is interrupted during the game play.

<h2>Indoor Navigation for Visually Impaired</h2>
<p class="meta"><em>Date: 2015-2017. Sponsorship: Fapesc (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina).</em></p>

<p class="description small">
Visually impaired people face numerous obstacles in their process of inclusion in society. Computer vision can be used to improve the quality of life for those individuals, contributing to the accessibility of places they go and helping solve difficulties they encounter daily. This project proposes the use of computer vision and image recognition to help visually impaired people navigate indoors using previously collected metadata. The purpose is to create a guide system that can aid the visually impaired by getting information about rooms, ladders, elevators, among others.

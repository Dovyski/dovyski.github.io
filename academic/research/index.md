<h2>READMINDS: REmote Analysis and Detection of Multifactorial INputs for Detection of Stress</h2>
<a href="./readmind/"><img src="/public/img/readmind-hero.jpg" title="READMINDS" /></a>
<p class="description small">
Improve the research in games by creating a model/software that is able to tell if a player is stressed/bored while playing a game. The process involves the analysis of information from the player (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, facial expressions) which are obtained by processing a video of the player. The procedure is completely remote, so the user does not wear physical sensors nor is interrupted during the game play.

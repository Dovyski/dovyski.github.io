I love everything code and open-source. Several hours of my free time are dedicated to coding. Below is a list of my most relevant software side-projects. You can find more about my software and open-source contributions on [Github](https://github.com/dovyski).

<h2>cvui <span class="type cpp">C++</span> <span class="type opencv">OpenCV</span></h2>
<p class="meta">A header-only C++ lib to create UI in OpenCV projects. I created this lib out of the need of creating a full GUI application using nothing but OpenCV.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dovyski/depository/master/cvui.png?20160819" title="cvui" /></a>
<p class="description">
A (very) simple UI lib built on top of OpenCV drawing primitives. Other UI libs, such as imgui, require a graphical backend (e.g. OpenGL) to work, so if you want to use imgui in a OpenCV app, you must make it OpenGL enabled, for instance. It is not the case with cvui, which uses only OpenCV drawing primitives to do all the rendering (no OpenGL or Qt required).

<h2>Codebot <span class="type php">PHP</span> <span class="type mysql">MySQL</span> <span class="type js">Javascript</span></h2>
<p class="meta">The back-end is PHP with no frameworks, serving REST APIs (speaking JSON). Front-end was built using HTML/CSS enhanced with jQuery, Bootstrap and some UI libs.</p>

<p class="description">
Codebot is a code editing program equipped with built-in tools to help you make your game faster (read full thoughts here). Developing a game is much more than just coding, you have to tweak art, build levels, convert files, find assets/extensions, read docs about building and publishing, and so on. The IDE should help us do that, or do it all by itself. Imagine you are working on your Ludum Dare/1GAM game and you need an 8-bit SFX. You click a button, a panel slides, you type in a few keywords, select what you want and done!

Share and remotely control your PDF-based presentations, all in the browser, without plugins or network restrictions. The process is simple: first you upload a PDF file to the website (no login required). When the upload is complete you receive two URLs: one for the presenter (can change the slides) and another for the viewers (can't change the slides). That's all!

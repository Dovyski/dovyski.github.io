I love everything code and open-source. Several hours of my free time are dedicated to coding. Below is a list of my most relevant software side-projects. You can find more about my software and open-source contributions on [Github](https://github.com/dovyski).

<h2>cvui <span class="type cpp">C++</span> <span class="type opencv">OpenCV</span></h2>
<p class="meta">A header-only C++ lib to create UI in OpenCV projects. I created this lib out of the need of creating a full GUI application using nothing but OpenCV.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dovyski/depository/master/cvui.png?20160819" title="cvui" /></a>
<p class="description">
A (very) simple UI lib built on top of OpenCV drawing primitives. Other UI libs, such as imgui, require a graphical backend (e.g. OpenGL) to work, so if you want to use imgui in a OpenCV app, you must make it OpenGL enabled, for instance. It is not the case with cvui, which uses only OpenCV drawing primitives to do all the rendering (no OpenGL or Qt required).

<h2>Codebot <span class="type php">PHP</span> <span class="type mysql">MySQL</span> <span class="type js">Javascript</span></h2>
<p class="meta">The back-end is PHP with no frameworks, serving REST APIs (speaking JSON). Front-end was built using jQuery, Bootstrap and some UI libs.</p>

<p class="description">
Codebot is a code editing program equipped with built-in tools to help you make your game faster (read full thoughts here). Developing a game is much more than just coding, you have to tweak art, build levels, convert files, find assets/extensions, read docs about building and publishing, and so on. The IDE should help us do that, or do it all by itself. Imagine you are working on your Ludum Dare/1GAM game and you need an 8-bit SFX. You click a button, a panel slides, you type in a few keywords, select what you want and done!

<h2>Jarena <span class="type java">Java</span></h2>
<p class="meta">I developed this project as a tool for my OOP classes. It is a gamified way of developing and learning about Java classes and objects.</p>

<p class="description">
A game approach to teaching OPP and Java. It is a battle arena where student-developed agents fight each other in order to survive. The last team to be eliminated from the arena wins the challenge.

- I was one of the main maintainers of [Flixel Community](http://flixelcommunity.org) (check the [Github company](https://github.com/FlixelCommunity/) for more information), a community-driven version of Flash game engine [Flixel](http://flixel.org).  

- I am the creator of [FeatureCreepRobot.com](https://featurecreeprobot.com), a web comic about game development.

- I wrote several tutorials and articles for the [Game Development](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/) area of [Tuts+](http://tutsplus.com), the Envato learning platform. The content of my articles/tutorials ranged from [steering behaviors](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732), networking programming and post mortems to sharing my experience as how I became a game developer. You can see all my published material [here](http://tutsplus.com/authors/fernando-bevilacqua).

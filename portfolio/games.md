Games are a significant part of my professional experience. Below is a break down of all my gamedev activities.

### My work at Decadium Studios <em>2004 to 2011</em>

Decadium Studios was a game developer company that my friends and I funded in 2003/2004. During my time at the company, I worked on several games directly (as a developer, manager, etc) or indirectly (participating in meetings, creating supporting tools, etc).

#### [Ryudragon](http://web.archive.org/web/20120501030123/http://ryudragon.uol.com.br/)
Ryudragon was an important step in my game developer career. It was a web-based MMO RPG game, the very first game the company published. I worked in the game for almost 7 years (2004 to 2011), since its conception to final days of life. It was part of UOL Games (the largest Internet content provider in Brazil) and it made the news on newspapers severals times in a state- and national-wide reach. Towards the end of its life, Ryudragon had been played by almost 300.000 players.

#### Other games
In total, we released 2 casual PC games (Aquadum and Gotcha: Celebrity Secrets), 3 MMO browser games (Ryudragon, Warjin and Guerra Secreta), 1 3D game (a soccer one that was part of a marketing campaign for a big Brazilian company) and 27 casual Flash games.

Below is a list of all games I worked directly or indirectly (all copyrights and trademarks belong to theirs respective owners):

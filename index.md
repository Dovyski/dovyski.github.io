My name is **Fernando Bevilacqua**, I am the CTO and Head of Development at [Optidata](https://optidata.cloud). Formely I was Adjunct Senior Lecturer of Computer Science at [Federal University of Fronteira Sul (UFFS)](http://www.uffs.edu.br), teaching programming and researching human-computer interaction and AI. Before that I was a [game developer](./portfolio/games/). I am a [passionate open-source contributor](https://github.com/Dovyski) who mainly work with web technologies, AI, games and human-computer interaction.

### ⚒️ Work

I have hands-on experience on a variety of technologies and software projects, including game development, enterprise application development, and finally research/teaching work related to human-computer interaction, computer graphics and programming. I've been a team member, team leader and also project manager. I've used a dozen of programming languages, such as C, C++, PHP, Flash/AS3, Haxe, Java, Javascript, Typescript, R, Matlab and Python.

### 🎓 Education

In 2007 I obtained a BSc degree in Computer Science at [Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)](http://www.ufsm.br), Brazil. In 2009 I finished my masters in Computation focused on Computer Graphics, also at UFSM. Finally, in 2018 I received my PhD in Informatics at the [University of Skövde](http://his.se), Sweden. I worked with human-computer interaction and computer vision at the [InGame Lab](http://www.his.se/en/Research/informatics/Interaction-Lab/InGaMe-Lab/).

### ✨ Cool stuff about me

- 🕹️ Co-founded a game development company and shipped a bunch of games (PC and web).
- 📚 I've been a lecturer of Computer Science for several years.
- 📡 I've been a consultant for companies working with healthtech, AI/speech, games and education.
- ⚡ Built my own code editor ([Codebot](https://github.com/Dovyski/Codebot)), then made it a web-based editor.
- 🔭 I wrote a [few scientific papers](https://www.fernandobevilacqua.com/academic/publications/) about emotions, games and computers.
- 🧐 Published a [software/method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoN8JuRZbwk) for detecting stress and boredom of players based on heart rate and facial actions (all done remotely, no sensors).
- 💬 I like to teach and write tutorials ([already wrote](https://tutsplus.com/authors/fernando-bevilacqua) about many topics related to gamedev).
- 🙌 The tutorial series [Understanding Steering Behaviors](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732) that I authored is top 1 result on Google regarding steering behaviors. It has also been praised by Craig W. Reynolds, the original invetor of the technique (🤯).
- 😅 Built a software ([Besearcher](https://github.com/Dovyski/Besearcher)) to run my experiments and e-mail me when anything interesting pops-up, so I could have more time for coffee.
- 💚 I've been involved with open source for quite a while. I've been a co-maintainer (of [Flixel Community](https://github.com/flixelcommunity), a game engine), main maintainer (of [cvui](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui), a C++/python ui lib for OpenCV) and contributor ([Haxeflixel](https://github.com/haxeflixel) and [Flixel Studio](https://github.com/Dovyski/flixel-studio), for instance).

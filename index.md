My name is Fernando Bevilacqua, I am a professor of Computer Science at [Federal University of Fronteira Sul (UFFS)](http://www.uffs.edu.br), [former game developer](./portfolio/games/) and [passionate open-source contributor](https://github.com/Dovyski). I mainly work with games, human-computer interaction and computer graphics.

In 2007 I obtained a BSc degree in Computer Science at [Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)](http://www.ufsm.br), Brazil. In 2009 I finished my masters in Computer Graphics, also at UFSM. Now I am a PhD student at the [University of Sk√∂vde](http://his.se), working with serious games at the [InGame Lab](http://www.his.se/en/Research/informatics/Interaction-Lab/InGaMe-Lab/).

I work with games since 2004. From 2004 to 2011 I was one of the co-founders of Decadium, a game developer company. During those 7 years I worked as a professional game developer, acting as senior programmer and/or project manager in a wide variety of entertainment applications. I worked in game related projects for companies like [Bigpoint](http://bigpoint.com/), [Playfirst](http://playfirst.com/), [Bigfish Games](http://www.bigfishgames.com/), [UOL](http://uol.com.br) and [SevenGames](http://sevengamesnetwork.de/). Since 2012 I use my free time as an indie game developer. I have experience developing games from conception to development, deployment and maintenance, including single-player and multiplayer (local or over the network) projects. I worked as a team member (developer) and as a team leader, managing other developers, artists and musicians.

I like to code and create new things, specially when they can help me or anyone somehow (check my [portfolio](./portfolio/) for a list of my projects). I spend a lot of my free time coding, for my own and for other open-source projects. I have hands-on experience on a variety of technologies and programming languages as C, C++, PHP, Flash/AS3, Java, Javascript, R and Matlab.
